# Final Project for COS 445: Reproducing Key Results in Gene Expression Analysis 

## Overview

In this project, I replicate the key findings the authors of "The metabolic background is a global player in Saccharomyces gene expression epistasis" published in their work. The original paper which I reproduce the findings of can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol201530).
